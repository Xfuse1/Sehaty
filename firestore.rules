/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for the Sehaty application.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model for personal data (users, appointments, lab test bookings)
 * while allowing public read access to shared resources (pharmacies, physiotherapy packages, doctors, clinics, nursing care packages, lab tests).
 * User-specific data is nested under `/users/{userId}` to ensure only the authenticated user can access their own data.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /users/{userId}: Stores user profiles.
 * - /users/{userId}/appointments/{appointmentId}: Stores appointments for a specific user.
 * - /users/{userId}/labTestBookings/{labTestBookingId}: Stores lab test bookings for a specific user.
 * - /pharmacies/{pharmacyId}: Stores pharmacy information.
 * - /physiotherapyPackages/{packageId}: Stores physiotherapy package information.
 * - /doctors/{doctorId}: Stores doctor information.
 * - /clinics/{clinicId}: Stores clinic information.
 * - /nursingCarePackages/{packageId}: Stores nursing care package information.
 * - /labTests/{labTestId}: Stores lab test information.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - User-owned data (users, appointments, labTestBookings) is strictly controlled via the `isOwner(userId)` function.
 * - Public data (pharmacies, physiotherapyPackages, doctors, clinics, nursingCarePackages, labTests) is readable by anyone.
 * - The rules do not enforce complex data validation in this prototyping phase.
 * - Path-based ownership is used to ensure that users can only access their own data.
 * - Authorization Independence is achieved by denormalizing the userId into the subcollections 'appointments' and 'labTestBookings'.
