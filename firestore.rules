/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for the Sehaty application.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model for personal data while allowing public read access to globally available data.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /users/{userId}: Stores personal user profiles, accessible only to the user themselves.
 * - /users/{userId}/appointments/{appointmentId}: Stores user-specific appointments, accessible only to the user.
 * - /users/{userId}/labTestBookings/{labTestBookingId}: Stores user-specific lab test bookings, accessible only to the user.
 * - /pharmacies/{pharmacyId}: Stores public pharmacy information, readable by all.
 * - /physiotherapyPackages/{packageId}: Stores public physiotherapy package information, readable by all.
 * - /doctors/{doctorId}: Stores public doctor information, readable by all.
 * - /clinics/{clinicId}: Stores public clinic information, readable by all.
 * - /nursingCarePackages/{packageId}: Stores public nursing care package information, readable by all.
 * - /labTests/{labTestId}: Stores public lab test information, readable by all.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - User data is strictly controlled: only the authenticated user can read or write their own profile and associated appointments/bookings.
 * - Public data (pharmacies, packages, doctors, clinics, lab tests) is readable by all users, including unauthenticated users.
 * - Listing of user documents is allowed for the owner.
 * - Data validation is relaxed to allow for rapid prototyping, focusing on authorization and relational integrity.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * - The 'appointments' and 'labTestBookings' subcollections include the 'userId' field in each document to ensure authorization independence.
 * This allows for efficient security rules without needing to query the parent '/users/{userId}' document.
