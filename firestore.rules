/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for Sehaty Application
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model for user profiles and their associated bookings.
 * It allows public read access to certain collections like pharmacies, physiotherapy packages, nursing care services, lab services, clinics and offers, while restricting write access to authorized users only.
 * A global bookings collection is added for admin access.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /users/{userId}: Stores user profiles, accessible only by the user themselves.
 * - /users/{userId}/bookings/{bookingId}: Stores booking information for a specific user, accessible only by that user.
 * - /pharmacies/{pharmacyId}: Stores pharmacy information, publicly readable.
 * - /physiotherapyPackages/{packageId}: Stores physiotherapy packages, publicly readable.
 * - /nursingCareServices/{nursingCareId}: Stores nursing care service information, publicly readable.
 * - /labServices/{labServiceId}: Stores lab service information, publicly readable.
 * - /clinics/{clinicId}: Stores clinic information, publicly readable.
 * - /clinics/{clinicId}/doctors/{doctorId}: Stores doctor information associated with a clinic, publicly readable.
 * - /bookings/{bookingId}: A global collection of all bookings, write restricted.
 * - /offers/{offerId}: Stores pharmacy offers, publicly readable.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Users can only access their own profile data and bookings.
 * - Listing of users is disallowed for privacy reasons.
 * - Public read access is granted to pharmacies, physiotherapy packages, nursing care services, lab services, clinics and offers.
 * - No schema validation is enforced in this prototyping phase to allow for flexible data evolution.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * The rules rely on path-based authorization and avoid using `get()` calls for efficiency.
 * For example, bookings are stored under the user's path to easily verify ownership.
 *
 * Structural Segregation:
 * User-specific data (profiles, bookings) is stored under the /users/{userId} path, while shared resources (pharmacies, physiotherapy packages, etc.) are stored in top-level collections.
