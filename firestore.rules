/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for the Sehaty application.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model for user-specific data
 * (e.g., bookings under /users/{userId}) and allows public read access to
 * shared resources like pharmacies and services. A top-level /bookings collection
 * is intended for admin access and would require separate role-based rules if implemented.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /users/{userId}: Stores user profiles.
 * - /users/{userId}/bookings/{bookingId}: Stores booking information for a specific user.
 * - /pharmacies/{pharmacyId}: Stores pharmacy information.
 * - /physiotherapyPackages/{packageId}: Stores physiotherapy packages.
 * - /nursingCareServices/{nursingCareId}: Stores nursing care service information.
 * - /labServices/{labServiceId}: Stores lab service information.
 * - /clinics/{clinicId}: Stores clinic information.
 * - /clinics/{clinicId}/doctors/{doctorId}: Stores doctor information associated with a clinic.
 * - /offers/{offerId}: Stores pharmacy offers.
 * - /bookings/{bookingId}: A global collection of all bookings for admin oversight.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - User listing is disabled.
 * - Public read access is granted to /pharmacies, /physiotherapyPackages, /nursingCareServices, /labServices, /clinics, and /offers.
 * - Strict ownership is enforced for data under /users/{userId}.
 * - No schema validation is performed beyond authorization-critical fields.
