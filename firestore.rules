/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for the Sehaty application.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model for user profiles, appointments, and lab test bookings.
 * Pharmacies, physiotherapy packages, doctors, clinics, nursing care packages, and lab tests are globally accessible for listing.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /users/{userId}: Stores user profiles. Only the user can read/write their own profile.
 * - /pharmacies/{pharmacyId}: Stores pharmacy information. Globally readable.
 * - /physiotherapyPackages/{packageId}: Stores physiotherapy package information. Globally readable.
 * - /users/{userId}/appointments/{appointmentId}: Stores appointments for a specific user. Only the user can read/write their own appointments.
 * - /doctors/{doctorId}: Stores doctor information. Globally readable.
 * - /clinics/{clinicId}: Stores clinic information. Globally readable.
 * - /nursingCarePackages/{packageId}: Stores nursing care package information. Globally readable.
 * - /labTests/{labTestId}: Stores lab test information. Globally readable.
 * - /users/{userId}/labTestBookings/{labTestBookingId}: Stores lab test bookings for a specific user. Only the user can read/write their own lab test bookings.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Users can only access their own data under the /users/{userId} path.
 * - Listing of user documents is disallowed.
 * - Public read access is granted to pharmacy, physiotherapy package, doctor, clinic, nursing care package, and lab test collections.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * - The 'userId' field is denormalized into the /users/{userId}/appointments/{appointmentId} and /users/{userId}/labTestBookings/{labTestBookingId}
 *   documents to allow for authorization independence and efficient security rules.
 *
 * Structural Segregation:
 * - User-owned data (appointments, lab test bookings) is stored in user-specific subcollections, separate from globally accessible data (pharmacies, doctors, etc.).
